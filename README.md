# HR Analytics-Employee Attrition & Performance
## Overview
###
This project explores IBM's HR data to understand why employees leave the company and how they perform in their jobs. The project includes two main reports: an Employee Attrition Overview and an Employee Performance Analysis. These reports, created using Power BI, provide key insights that can help improve HR practices and decision-making.
## Project Goals
### 
1.Analyze Demographics: Understand the distribution of employees by age, gender, department, and job role.

2.Identify Attrition Factors: Determine the key factors contributing to employee attrition, such as job satisfaction, work-life balance, and compensation.

3.Evaluate Performance: Assess performance ratings and identify high performers and areas for improvement across departments.

## Reports
## Employee Attrition Overview

This report shows employee attrition based on different factors:

1. Age Group: It looks at which age groups are more likely to leave the company.
2. Department: The report shows which departments have higher employee turnover.
3. Job Role: It analyzes which job roles have more employees leaving.
4. Education: The report checks if employees' education affects their likelihood of leaving.
5. Years at Company: It also looks at whether employees who have been with the company for different lengths of time are more likely to leave


This report helps to find out who is leaving the company and why. It gives useful insights into patterns and trends that can help create better strategies to keep employees from leaving.
## Employee Performance Analysis 
###

This report shows the performance of employees based on several key factors:

1. Age Group: Employee performance is analyzed across different age groups to identify any trends or patterns.

2. Department: The report highlights which departments have the highest and lowest performing employees, providing insights into overall departmental effectiveness.

3. Job Role: Performance is compared across different job roles, allowing us to see how specific positions contribute to the company's success.

4. Education: The impact of employees' educational background on their performance is evaluated, helping to understand the role education plays in job success.

5. Years at Company: The report examines how the length of time an employee has been with the company affects their performance, providing insights into the value of experience and tenure.


This analysis helps to understand employee performance based on these factors, guiding decisions on promotions, training, and identifying areas where improvements are needed within the organization.

## Key Findings
1. The company has a high attrition rate of 16.1%, with 238 employees leaving out of 1,480.

2. More men (151) are leaving compared to women (87), raising concerns about gender-based turnover.

4. The majority of employees leaving are aged 26-35, with 116 out of 238 in this age group.

5. Higher attrition is observed among Laboratory Technicians (23.75%), Sales Executives (17.63%), and Research Scientists (16.04%).

6. Employees with shorter tenures, particularly those with only 1 year (59 employees), are leaving more frequently.

## Recommendations
1. Conduct exit interviews to understand why employees, especially in key departments and age groups, are leaving.

2. Enhance the first-year experience for new employees to increase their retention.

3. Address the challenges faced by Laboratory Technicians, Sales Executives, and Research Scientists to improve their job satisfaction.

4. Develop targeted retention strategies for critical departments, age groups, and job roles.

## Tools Used
